  'lyrics': u'Yo left, yo left, yo left right left \nYo left, yo left, yo left right left \nYo left, yo left, yo left right left \nYo left, yo left, yo left right left \n \n\'Til I collapse I\'m spilling these raps long as you feel \'em \n\'Til the day that I drop you\'ll never say that I\'m not killing them \n\'Cause when I am not then I\'m \'a stop pinning \'em \nAnd I am not hip-hop and I\'m just not Eminem. \n \nSubliminal thoughts when I\'m \'a stop sending \nThem women are caught in webs spin and hock venom \nAdrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop. \nAmoxicillin is just not real enough. \n \nThe criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners. \nYou\'re coming with me, feel it or not you\'re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us. \n \nYou hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up. \nFor shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck. \n \n \n\'Til the roof comes off, \'til the lights go out \n\'Til my legs give out, can\'t shut my mouth. \n\'Til the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps \nI\'m \'a rip this shit \'til my bones collapse. \n \n\'Til the roof comes off, \'til the lights go out \n\'Til my legs give out, can\'t shut my mouth. \n\'Til the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps \nI\'m \'a rip this shit \'til my bones collapse. \n \nMusic is like magic there\'s a certain feeling you get when you\'re real \nAnd you spit and people are feeling your shit. \nThis is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it \n\'Cause you may never get it again. \n \nSo while you\'re in it try to get as much shit as you can \nAnd when your run is over just admit when it\'s at its end. \n\'Cause I\'m at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in. \nI got a list here\'s the order of my list that it\'s in. \n \nIt goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me. \nBut in this industry I\'m the cause of a lot of envy, so when I\'m not put on this list the shit does not offend me. \n \nThat\'s why you see me walk around like nothing\'s bothering me. \nEven though half you people got a fucking problem with me. \nYou hate it but you know respect you\'ve got to give me \nThe press\'s wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate, hit me. \n \n \n\'Til the roof comes off, \'til the lights go out \n\'Til my legs give out, can\'t shut my mouth. \n\'Til the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps \nI\'m \'a rip this shit \'til my bones collapse. \n \n\'Til the roof comes off, \'til the lights go out \n\'Til my legs give out, can\'t shut my mouth. \n\'Til the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps \nI\'m \'a rip this shit \'til my bones collapse. \n \nSoon as a verse starts I eat it at MC\'s heart \nWhat is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart. \nAnd it\'s absurd how people hang on every word. \nI\'ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve \n \nBut I\'ll never be served my spot is forever reserved \nIf I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first. \n\'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse. \nThat\'s why I\'m clever when I put together every verse \n \nMy thoughts are sporadic, I act like I\'m an addict \nI rap like I\'m addicted to smack like I\'m Kim Mathers. \nBut I don\'t want to go forth and back in constant battles \nThe fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers. \n \nSo this is like a full-blown attack I\'m launching at them \nThe track is on some battling raps who want some static \n\'Cause I don\'t really think that the fact that I\'m Slim matters \nA plaque of platinum status is whack if I\'m not the baddest. So... \n \n \n\'Til the roof comes off, \'til the lights go out \n\'Til my legs give out, can\'t shut my mouth. \n\'Til the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps \nI\'m \'a rip this shit \'til my bones collapse. \n \n\'Til the roof comes off, \'til the lights go out \n\'Til my legs give out, can\'t shut my mouth. \n\'Til the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps \nI\'m \'a rip this shit \'til my bones collapse. \n \n \nUntil the roof \nThe roof comes off \nUntil my legs \nGive out from underneath me \n \n \nI will not fall, \nI will stand tall, \nFeels like no one can beat me.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe song has never been released as a single, but it has managed to chart many times all over the world.\n \n \nThis track samples the stomping beat made famous by the rock band   on their song   (1977).\n \n \nIn 2018 the song was certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for digital sales of 5,000,000 copies in the USA.\n \n \nCleveland Cavaliers\' team used this song during the 2010\u201311 NBA season as their introduction song.\n \n \nThe film "Real Steel" (2011) features "Till I Collapse" on its trailer and soundtrack.\n  (2002)',
