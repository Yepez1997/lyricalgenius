He explains in this song that his mother worked as a florist. His another song "God\'s Plan" also has a reference to his mother where he raps,  \n \n \n"Louisville hush money" is a reference to two scandals involving the University of Louisville: in 2015 with allegations of throwing sex parties with strippers in dorms for recruits and players; and in 2017 when it was found that a recruit was paid a bribe to violate NCAA rules. Rick Pitino was the head coach of the basketball team during these times.\n \n \nKaty Perry\'s song "California Gurls" is referenced in this song\'s line "California girls sweeter than pieces of candy".\n \n \nDrake compares his success with that of Adele, saying in this song, "Every title doing numbers like I\'m Miss Adele." On one hand his records are being sold in great numbers like hers, on the other hand he remarks that   albums have number titles, like "19", "21", "25".\n  (2018)',
