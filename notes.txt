DB Associations 
TO DO 
Seed data
Set Up redux for the data
    Jbuilder etc etc 


yikes need to be updating this more 
okay so need to 
    1. write pyhton function to add p tags to the end of every row 
    2. use that lyric data to add onto the page 
        a. How ? use jquery to convert string object to html object
        b. 


for backend to check for validations 
need to find out which p tags/ rows are associated with the annotation
for the annotation should render the annotation on the same page
    ex on genius website 
        the annotation renders the lyric page + the  lyric 
        perhaps need to re render the lyric again ? waste of re rendering ? 
        lyric_annotation -> lyrical_genius/annotation_id 
        ? how do i get that info ?  
            perhaps when the user is on the song the p tag hold information on the lyric_annotation
            thus can render that annotation id !@@@#@$@#TERGERGHWRGVW#@$@#%
                    GOT IT  
            %
for now focus on highlighting one lyric 



other notes 
    when clicking on a lyric 
    if the user is not signed in then need 
        show need to sing in component 
    else 
        allow the user to annotate 
        need to keep track of which p tags were highlighted 

if someone encounters this .txt excuse my vernacular ...


may 5th 2015 

    at the beggining want to render all annotaions with their highlights 
    once the user clicks the button over the highlight
        we should be able to see the old page + /annotaionid-route

    okay now need to figure out how to create an annotation
    this is tricky 
        perhaps need to do a joins table 
        due to the way my data is structured on the lyrics page
        each line on the lyrics page is a button and 
        i did something clever such thatevery button generated 
        has a class name to uniquely identify that button 
            ie the first button has className=1 , second has className=2 
        Given that each button holds information we want to be able to click
        any amount of buttons and add an annotaion 
        once a button is clicked want to dispacht an action that this button has been clicked 

        Song 
            has many annotaions
        Annotaion 
            belongs to song 
        Song Row
            belongs to song_annotation


        # need an annotations reducer 
        annotataions state 
            song 1 has annotaions
                    1 {
                        paragraphs/triggered [1,2]
                        author
                        body
                    }
                    2 {
                        paragraphs triggerde [5,6,7]
                        author 
                        body
                    }
                    3 {
                        author 
                        body
                    }
                    4 {
                        author 
                        body
                    }     

            song 2 has annotaions 
                    5 {
                        author
                        body

                    }
                   

            want to create annotation if the 
            need to add validation where a song cannot have the same paragraphs triggered 
            paragraphs triggered should be highlighted and trigger the annotation on the right side 


        song row depends on the song -> will be differennt for every song 

    first want to dispatch to create links 
    then after creating the neccesary links want to create the annotionn and render from there 
    seems link a perfectly valid apporach 
    

how to know when to stop creating links ?
know when to stop when the user has submited 
if the user never submited want to restore the original state 
maybe have a desroy functionalry or in the reducer should have a method
to dispatch to restore to original state
