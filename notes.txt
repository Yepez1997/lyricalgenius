TO DO

    Jbuilder etc etc 


yikes need to be updating this more 
okay so need to 
    1. write pyhton function to add p tags to the end of every row 
    2. use that lyric data to add onto the page 
        a. How ? use jquery to convert string object to html object
        b. 


for backend to check for validations 
need to find out which p tags/ rows are associated with the annotation
for the annotation should render the annotation on the same page
    ex on genius website 
        the annotation renders the lyric page + the  lyric 
        perhaps need to re render the lyric again ? waste of re rendering ? 
        lyric_annotation -> lyrical_genius/annotation_id 
        ? how do i get that info ?  
            perhaps when the user is on the song the p tag hold information on the lyric_annotation
            thus can render that annotation id !@@@#@$@#TERGERGHWRGVW#@$@#%
                    GOT IT  
            %
for now focus on highlighting one lyric 



other notes 
    when clicking on a lyric 
    if the user is not signed in then need 
        show need to sing in component 
    else 
        allow the user to annotate 
        need to keep track of which p tags were highlighted 

if someone encounters this .txt excuse my vernacular ...
